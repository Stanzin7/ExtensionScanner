Are you looking for Firefox extensions to help you take your browser experience to the next level? Look no further.

Extensions and add-ons can improve your browsing experience and help you do everything from managing your passwords to recording your screen.

If there’s any functionality you’re missing in Firefox, the chances are that you can add what you need through an extension.

This article will break down how to install and manage extensions. It will also showcase the best extensions and add-ons available for Firefox in various categories.

Read on to learn how to make the most of your Firefox browsing experience.

What Are Firefox Extensions (Also Called Firefox Add-Ons)?
Firefox extensions, previously known as Firefox Add-ons, are tiny programs that function within the web browser to extend its functionality.

For example, Privacy Badger is an extension you can install onto Firefox to stop invisible tracking scripts from tracking your every move online.

By installing and adding it to Firefox, you add that extra functionality and change your browsing experience.

All kinds of extensions are available that can add different features to your Firefox browser.

For example, you can use them to take screen captures, rearrange your Firefox tabs, check your grammar, set up dark mode on every website, and more.

If you want a little extra something out of Firefox, and you’re thinking about changing browsers, a Firefox extension might do the job instead.

These extensions and add-ons are available in the public Firefox extension library and other locations online.

You can easily download and install them from within Firefox with a few clicks — more on this later.

Are Firefox Extensions Safe?
Firefox extensions are generally safe to install and use as long as you take the proper precautions.

Independent third parties develop firefox extensions, but the most popular ones are subject to safety testing before Mozilla accepts each new version. So while popular extensions are generally safe, you should take some precautions.

Every extension submitted to the official Firefox add-ons directory is scanned for issues, but not all are reviewed manually.

Even Mozilla itself recommends being mindful of what permissions an extension asks for.

Mozilla also recommends that users ask themselves several questions before installing a plugin, including whether they trust the developer or brand behind it.

But there are no added risks with Firefox extensions specifically. The concerns are the same as with Chrome extensions, for example.

Major extensions developed by reliable brands and developers are typically safe, while something less known could pose some level of risk.

If Mozilla puts a badge onto an add-on that warns, “this add-on is not actively monitored by Mozilla,” you should make 100% sure it’s from a reputable source.

As long as you follow the precautions outlined above, you won’t face any additional risks because of Firefox extensions.

How to Install and Remove Firefox Extensions
To install a Firefox extension, you need to go to the official Firefox extension library. You can install extensions in other ways, but they may involve some risk unless the publisher is 100% trustworthy.

From there, you can either search for a specific extension or browse categories until you find one that interests you.

You can find these categories immediately on the homepage and explore them by clicking on the ones you’re interested in.

The Firefox Extensions Library

If you have a specific functionality or purpose in mind, you can also search for a new add-on using any keywords you want.

For example, if you want to get better control over all your open tabs, you could search for “tab management.”

Firefox extension search results

You can then filter the results by relevance, most users, top-rated, trending, and more. That makes it easy to quickly find the type of extension you want for your browser.

Once you find an extension you like, click the result to open the extension page. You can see the add-on’s rating and more information about what it does on this page.

Add extension to Firefox button
Click on the Add to Firefox button.
Clicking this button will trigger a prompt in Firefox asking you if you want to add the extension and explaining the permissions it’s requesting for.

If you’re comfortable with the permissions, click “add.” That will officially add the new Firefox add-on to your browser.

You should now see the successful installation message in the top-right corner of your browser.

You’ve successfully installed a Firefox extension. To use or see the new functionality in action, you may need to refresh the tab or close and reopen Firefox.

Now that you understand how to install an extension, let’s cover how to manage and uninstall them. After all, you don’t want to end up with a browser overloaded with heavy extensions you don’t need.

Managing and Uninstalling Firefox Extensions
Managing your extensions as you install them, and uninstalling them as you go, are essential parts of using extensions.

Specific Firefox add-ons can use quite a lot of RAM and CPU depending on their purpose. To keep the Firefox browser light and run optimally on your computer, you should only keep the extensions you actively use.

To see all your Firefox extensions, you need to open your library of add-ons. You can either open up the menu and click the “Add-ons” link, use the Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + A keyboard shortcut, or type “about: add-ons” into the URL bar.

Find the Firefox add-ons in the menu

That will open a page with the headline “Manage Your Extensions.” Here, you can see every add-on you’ve ever installed.

To uninstall an extension, click the menu link on the extension you want to remove, and select the “Remove” option.

Remove Firefox extension
Remove Firefox extension.
All Firefox extensions are enabled by default upon installation.

If you only use an extension sometimes, and you want to speed up your browsing experience whenever you don’t, you can also disable an extension instead of uninstalling it.

To disable an extension, click the blue toggle button and ensure it’s grey instead of blue.

Where Are Firefox Extensions Stored?
If you’re wondering where Firefox stores the extension files and related data on your computer, it depends on your operating system.

In Windows, data from your add-ons is stored in the app data folder under your personal user:

C Drive > Users > USERNAME > AppData > Roaming > Mozilla > Firefox > Profiles > VERSIONNUMBER.default > extensions

Extensions folder in File Explorer in Windows
Extensions folder in File Explorer in Windows.
On a Mac computer, you’ll find the add-on files in a similar location inside your user’s library folder:

Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/VERSIONNUMBER.default/extensions

Important
Even if you can’t find this folder, you can remove an extension and all related data by following the instructions in the section above.

The average user likely won’t need to find the actual file location of the extensions.

The only reason to do this is if you want to be highly cautious and scan new extension files with anti-malware or antivirus software (unless there’s a badge saying Mozilla doesn’t actively monitor it, that isn’t strictly necessary.)

By now, you should understand precisely how to find, install, and manage existing Firefox extensions, so it’s time to share our recommendations with you.

We’ve compiled a list of 12 extensions in various categories to help you get more out of your web browser.
