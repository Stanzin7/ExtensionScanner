## Open-source status (Update — Feb 16, 2026)
My full codebase currently lives in a separate private repo while I stabilize the architecture and scoring engine.

**Open-sourcing begins Feb 28, 2026**  
Starting Feb 28, I’ll begin publishing the core open-source components here and expand the repo incrementally in small, reviewable batches.

## Relationship to ThreatXtension
This project builds on the ThreatXtension foundation and aims to stay upstream-friendly — as ThreatXtension improves, we improve too.

## Future direction
- Community-driven scanning + reporting/reviews
- Evidence-backed stats and reports
