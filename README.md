Ahhh… just found out there’s a site called ExtensionAuditor that’s rebranding to ExtensionScanner.
Probably to avoid legal / naming issues, since we’re in the same space — except I’m offering this for free (at least for now :).

My full codebase lives in a separate private repo right now. I’m gradually open-sourcing parts of it as I clean up the pipeline.

Credits / Reference: I’m using ThreatXtension as the first-layer engine, and then building a much larger layer on top: custom rulesets + compliance/governance logic.

Heads up: I’m using AI to refactor and move files around, so things may look messy for a day or two — check back in ~48 hours while I stabilize the structure.

Long-term plan: wire this frontend into the ThreatXtension engine running in the background, plus my rulesets, 
so anyone can scan extensions, play around with the results, and suggest fixes / improvements.
