## Open-source status (Update — Feb 16, 2026)
My full codebase currently lives in a separate private repo while I stabilize the architecture and scoring engine.

**Open-sourcing begins Feb 28, 2026**  
Starting Feb 28, I’ll begin publishing the core open-source components here and expand the repo incrementally in small, reviewable batches.

## How it works (Security vs Privacy/Compliance)
**Security scanning** is powered by the open-source **ThreatXtension** foundation (static analysis + risk signals).
ExtensionShield builds on top of that and adds:
- **Privacy analysis** (data collection, tracking, permissions-to-behavior mapping)
- **Compliance & governance layers** (e.g., GDPR-oriented controls, policy rulepacks, org-level enforcement)

Because privacy/compliance requirements and policies evolve over time, we maintain **customizable, updateable rulepacks** — and enterprises can 
use tailored compliance profiles that match their internal policies and regulatory needs.

## Future direction
- Community-driven scanning + reporting/reviews
- Evidence-backed stats and reports
- API as a service (enterprise-friendly)

Quite a progress we have made in last month. Thanks for QA and help guys we will open soon
